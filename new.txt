I Wish you many many Smiling Moments in your life, love in your heart and peace to your soul..KEEP SMILING...


Making through another year by walking through valleys high and mountains low to get to that spot where you are standing now is a cause to celebrate, but having done so with such grace is an even greater accomplishment.

Well, Anuragh describing you is tough for me because sometimes you will do shit things but all I know about you is that you are a great person who always stands for friends. Sometimes you will be so annoying when you make sudden plans without asking a  person at that time I will be like ”pagal hai yeah” but anyways Happy birthday dude jo be hai mast hai tu...🎂🎂🍻🍻
